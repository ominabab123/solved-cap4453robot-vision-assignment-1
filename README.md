(5 points) Modify the Sobel program to do thresholding on the gradient magnitude out­put to find edge points, and run it on the image face05. Produce three output images: one showing the magnitude of the gradient, one black/white image showing where the magni­tude exceeds a liberal (low) threshold so that all the correct edges are in, and the last one a black/white image showing where the magnitude exceeds a restrictive (high) threshold so that only true outline fragments are shown. You can use and modify the code in sobel.c from the web-page. Write your program in a manner such that it only has to run once to produce the three output images.

 <li>(90 points) Write a program for the following. Implement the Canny edge detector to accept as input a value for sigma. Run it on garb34.pgm. Produce three output images: one showing the magnitude of the gradient (scaled to fit within the range 0 – 255), one black/white image showing where candidates (the peaks) exist, and the final black/white image showing the result of double-thresholding these candidates. Include code that au­tomatically selects the HIGH and LOW thresholds. So, you will input to the program a percentage number that will be used to compute the thresholds. Print to the screen the values the program chooses for these thresholds. Run your program for sigma = 1.0, and show the output.</li>
